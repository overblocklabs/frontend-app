# Lotellar – Decentralized Voting & Lottery System

## 🧠 Summary
Lotellar is a fully decentralized Web3 application built on the Stellar Soroban smart contract platform that enables trustless lotteries and transparent voting. Designed with transparency, user-friendliness, and accessibility in mind, Lotellar aims to democratize participation in public draws and polls using blockchain-native identity and randomness.

## 🔧 Key Features
- 🎲 Lottery Mechanism: Provably fair lottery draws using on-chain pseudo-randomness via Soroban's vm::random, offering a VRF-like experience.
- 🗳️ Voting System: Lightweight and anonymous voting modules ideal for DAOs, communities, and decentralized governance.
- 🔐 Passkey Authentication: Uses modern Passkey/WebAuthn authentication to provide seamless, passwordless login tied to a user's device.
- 🔗 Freighter Wallet Integration: Interact with Soroban smart contracts directly via Freighter for signing transactions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js + TailwindCSS + TypeScript
- Smart Contracts: Rust (Stellar Soroban)
- Wallet & Signing: Freighter
- Authentication: Passkey/Freighter

## 📌 Use Cases
- DAO decision-making (on-chain voting)
- Transparent NFT/Token lotteries
- Raffle giveaways for Web3 communities
- Web3-native anonymous polling

## 🌍 Vision
Lotellar envisions a world where trustless random draws and governance are not exclusive to tech-savvy crypto users but accessible to everyone, everywhere — leveraging blockchain not as a barrier, but as an enabler of fairness and autonomy.

## 👥 Team
Lotellar was built by a 4-person team of developers and designers with a shared passion for decentralized systems, trustless infrastructure, and accessible crypto UX. We combined our strengths in smart contract development, frontend engineering, product design, and blockchain architecture to deliver a seamless Web3 experience.
