# Lotellar – Decentralized Voting & Lottery System

## 🧠 Summary
Lotellar is a fully decentralized Web3 application built on the Stellar Soroban smart contract platform that enables trustless lotteries and transparent voting. Designed with transparency, user-friendliness, and accessibility in mind, Lotellar aims to democratize participation in public draws and polls using blockchain-native identity and randomness.

## 🔧 Key Features
- 🎲 Lottery Mechanism: Provably fair lottery draws using on-chain pseudo-randomness via Soroban's vm::random, offering a VRF-like experience.
- 🗳️ Voting System: Lightweight and anonymous voting modules ideal for communities, and decentralized governance.
- 🔐 Passkey Authentication: Uses modern Passkey/WebAuthn authentication to provide seamless, passwordless login tied to a user's device.
- 🔗 Freighter Wallet Integration: Interact with Soroban smart contracts directly via Freighter for signing transactions.

## 🧰 Installation & Usage

This project uses **[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)** as the package manager.  
Make sure you have it installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### 🔧 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```


### ⚙️ 2. Set Up Environment Variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
📝 Fill in the required values in your .env file before running the app.

### 🧪 3. Run in Development Mode
```bash
pnpm dev
```


### 🏗️ 4. Build for Production
```bash
pnpm build
```

### ⚙️ Deployment & CI/CD Workflow
```bash
pnpm start
```
---

## ⚙️ Deployment & CI/CD Workflow

Lotellar uses a robust CI/CD setup combining **local pre-commit checks** and **GitHub Actions workflows** to ensure code quality, type safety, and build integrity before any deployment.

### 🔄 Local Development Pipeline (via Husky)

1. **Pre-commit Hook**
   - ✅ `pnpm lint` – Ensures code style and formatting
   - ✅ `pnpm type-check` – Verifies TypeScript correctness

2. **Pre-push Hook**
   - ✅ `pnpm build` – Builds the application to catch runtime or build-time errors before pushing

3. **Commit Message Check**
   - ✅ `commitlint` – Enforces conventional commit rules

---

### ☁️ GitHub Actions Workflows

Once code is pushed to GitHub, the following workflows run:

| Workflow Name       | Purpose                            |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| ✅ `build-check.yml` | Verifies production build integrity |
| 🧹 `linter.yml`       | Runs ESLint to ensure code style    |
| 🧠 `type-check.yml`   | Validates TypeScript types          |
| ✍️ `commitlint.yml`   | Checks commit messages              |
